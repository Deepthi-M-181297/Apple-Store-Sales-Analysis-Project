Welcome to the Apple Store Sales Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing extensive
sales data from Apple stores to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can optimize
business strategies and operational efficiencies.
## Introduction
This project dives deep into analyzing over 1 million sales records from Apple stores. Through
SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to extract valuable insights that can inform
decision-making and enhance business performance.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains detailed sales information from Apple stores, including sales dates,
product details, store locations, and revenue metrics. Prior to analysis, the dataset underwent
extensive preprocessing, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and
creation of new indices and features like the day of sale and profit calculations based on product
and sales data joins.
## Analysis Questions Resolved
During the analysis, the project addressed the following key questions using SQL queries and
advanced data analysis techniques:
1. Rank products based on total sales revenue, showing the product name and its rank.

2. Identify stores with the highest sales quantity, showing the store name and total
quantity sold, ranked using dense_rank.

3. Calculate total sales amount for each month across all stores.

4. Calculate the profit margin (profit as a percentage of revenue) for each product.

5. Identify stores where the total sales quantity has decreased compared to the previous month.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![ERD Image](https://github.com/Deepthi-M-181297/Apple-Store-Sales-Analysis-Project/blob/main/ERD_diagram_Apple.png)
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the database schema and
relationships between the tables. This diagram provides clarity on how different entities (e.g.,
stores, products, sales) are connected within the dataset.
## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to perform data analysis and derive
insights.
5. Customize queries as needed to address specific analytical objectives or questions.
## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to provide actionable insights into Apple store sales performance,
customer behaviors, and operational efficiencies. By leveraging SQL and data analysis,
stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize business strategies and drive growth.
Feel free to explore the repository, contribute to further analysis, or adapt the project for your
specific business needs!
